Subject: [PATCH] nl80211: fix netlink portid usage

The patch:

commit 15e473046cb6e5d18a4d0057e61d76315230382b
Author: Eric W. Biederman <ebiederm@xmission.com>

    netlink: Rename pid to portid to avoid confusion

    It is a frequent mistake to confuse the netlink port identifier with a
    process identifier.  Try to reduce this confusion by renaming fields
    that hold port identifiers portid instead of pid.

    I have carefully avoided changing the structures exported to
    userspace to avoid changing the userspace API.

    I have successfully built an allyesconfig kernel with this change.

Changed the struct members:

struct netlink_notify->pid    to
struct netlink_notify->portid

struct genl_info->snd_pid     to
struct genl_info->snd_portid

To help backport this and not have to #ifdef around it against
kernel versions compat has introduced two helpers for us to
simply do the backport with two macro helpers:

genl_info_snd_portid()
netlink_notify_portid()

most of this has been taken care of in the compat patch
"0005-netlink-portid.patch"

modify nl80211.c to use genl_info_snd_portid() where the previous patch was
missing it.
