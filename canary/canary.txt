Canary in the Coal Mine
=======================
This file gets installed to /system/etc/canary on the target.  It serves *only*
to provide a standard Android build target.  A signature example:
 * we build the Linux kernel from source using a non-Android style Makefile
 * the kernel build installs files into the /system output directory
 * as such, an updated kernel means system.img etc. needs to be updated
 * PRODUCT_PACKAGES += "linux" doesn't work---Linux is not an Android Makefile
 * adding a dependency on the 'droid' target is also insufficient---too late
 * so...

We add this dummy 'canary' module to our build:
 PRODUCT_PACKAGES += canary

In any non-Android style Makefile that needs to install files into system, we
add the desired Make target as a pre-requisite on the output of the canary
module:
  $(TARGET_OUT)/etc/canary: $(INSTALLED_KERNEL_TARGET)

Ta-da!  Okay, that is a bit convoluted but I haven't figured out how to
convince the Android Build System to accomodate this dependency otherwise. And
yes, we actually could use any standard Android file as a dependency---making
it very explicit here seems a little less magical :).

Tips and suggestions welcome!
